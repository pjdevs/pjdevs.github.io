## Description

ALKA is an online multiplayer game where 2 to 4 players take control of armed drones whose duty is to eliminate an infection spreading in a bunger after the humanity has disappeared. They will have to destroyed nodes of infection which are protected by various enemies.

## Project overview

Our team worked on the project during two quarters. The first was a pre-production phase and the second a production phase.
We were in an every-day collaboration with the artists during the production phase after some prototyping.

We had an Agile workflow with Sprint Reviews and Build Reviews once a week and every two weeks. Moreover, tasks were distributed with tickets on a Kanban like board. Each task had <span style="color:gold">Gold</span>, <span style="color:silver">Silver</span>, <span style="color:maroon">Bronze</span> steps to validate a certain level of *polish*.

## My contribution to the project


## Technical and Design challenges

### Online multiplayer game

ALKA was my first online multiplayer game programming experience. As I could see, this increases the complexity of development, requiring several elements to be put in place for smooth and optimal functioning. Thus, I had to learn as I worked on the project, which proved to be quite a challenge but also very instructive. In the context of my AI work, it was particularly important that the actions of the various enemies were correctly reflected in the game instances of each player.

### Adaptation to a project already started

When I joined the team, the project was already well under way. Also, the vast majority of programmers who were on the project the previous semester were no longer there. So there was a certain period of adjusment where I had to analyze the code and the funcioning of the project in order to make additions and modifications.

### Collaboration with multiple universities

Alka is a game developed in collaboration with 3 universities. This collaboration brings its share of challenges, such as the distance which leads in a less easy communication. Indeed, we had to learn how to communicate effectively and use teamwork tools such as Microsoft Teams to ensure good cohesion within the large team that we form. In short, I believe that communication was one of our greatest strengths in the project.
