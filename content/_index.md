# About me

***Graphics and game programming** enthusiast looking for a **2023 summer internship**.*

## Education

I studied computer science and engineering at [ENSEIRB-MATMECA, Talence, France](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/) 2018-2023 to get a Master's degree.

I am studying game programming at [UQAC, Chicoutimi, Qu√©bec](https://uqac.ca/) 2022-2023 to get a Master's degree.

## Interests

I am passionate of **graphics programming** and everything related to **video game development**.
I enjoy discovering new technologies or new techniques of rendering.
Moreover, I really like the research process as I've already colaborated to write a research paper in Combinatorics which was published in the [JIS](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL25/Bonichon/bonichon3.html).
