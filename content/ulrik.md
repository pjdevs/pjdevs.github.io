## Description

Ulrik is 3D singleplayer bosh-rush third-person action game. A prisonner viking is released by the village to help fight magic creatures that are destroying everything. Gather food to prepare for combat and destroy all the bosses. 

## Project overview

The game was developed by a team of 4 programmers during fall quarter at UQAC (1 month of pre-production, 2 months of production and 1 week of post-production).
The team had a full game conception process including making a concept document, a game design document, programming the game and making a trailer.
We had an Agile workflow with Sprint Reviews and Build Reviews once a week. Trelo was used as a kanban style board for project management.
